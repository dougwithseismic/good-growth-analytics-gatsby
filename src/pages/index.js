                  Most brands know what success should look like, and even know how to properly connect the dots and put
                  into practice the plans needed to reach their goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, even with great intentions, many teams don't see the traction the need, and even fewer know
                  what to do once their strategy fails to provide the results promised. Blog posts and slack groups are
                  great at spinning a best-practice success story, but very few set you up to handle the nuances and
                  reality of doing digital business.

                  That's where I position myself - Working alongside B2C brands to put them on the right track for
